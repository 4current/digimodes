Digital modes mainly run using AFSK (audio frequency shift keying) and all you need is a computer sound card to get started. It sounds so easy, but getting started was so hard. Here's what I started with:

Rig
:   ICOM IC-718

Antenna
:   Off center fed longwire, about 124 ft. long up about 35 ft.

PC
:   ASUS Laptop

Being a hobbyist, I like the DIY approach.

CAT control: FTDI USB cable with 1/8" TR connector.
AF/PTT: Home Brew -
