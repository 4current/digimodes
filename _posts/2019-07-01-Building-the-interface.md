Digital modes mainly run using AFSK (audio frequency shift keying) and all you need is a computer sound card to get started. It sounds so easy, but getting started was so hard. Here's what I started with:

* Rig: ICOM IC-718

* Antenna: Off center fed longwire, about 124 ft. long up about 35 ft.

* PC: ASUS Laptop

Being a hobbyist, I like the DIY approach. So rather than buying a commercially built interface, I looks for adapters.

CAT control: FTDI USB cable with 1/8" TR connector.
AF/PTT: Home Brew.

Interface Cable: MFJ-5213
Cost: $13.95
